<h1>Lab 13</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    "Not Uber" is a ride hailing app designed by Tufts University computer science professor Ming Chow. Pettibone and 
    Associates Total Securityâ„¢ was "hired" to study the app, find any potential security vulnerabilities, and report
    them back to Mr. Chow.
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
    In order to test this app, it was important to have a working version of it. The files <code>server-vuln.js</code> and <code>package.json</code> 
    were put into a folder and <code>npm install</code> was run in the terminal in order to install all dependencies. After that, a 
    PostgreSQL database was created locally with the same design as was implied by <code>server-vuln.js</code>. Dummy entries were 
    inserted into this database. Then, the app was run with the terminal command <code>node server-vuln.js</code>.
</p>
<p>
    After all this was set up, the code in <code>server-vuln.js</code> was visually scanned line by line. When a potential vulnerability
    was found, it was verified either by visiting <code>http://localhost:3000/...</code> or using the command line tool <code>curl</code> to
    send the app data via POST requests. 
</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<p>
    The primary finding of this investigation is that the app's database is extremely vulnerable via SQL injection. It is 
    possible to dump database contents and even delete database tables entirely. Another finding is the fact that user 
    location data (latitude and longitude) are visible to third parties. A third finding is that the app readily shares 
    data across web domains, potentially allowing malicious actors access confidential information. Lastly, the server 
    is potentially vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these issues hits a corner of the venerable CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Accessibility, and 
    should be remedied as soon as possible.
</p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issue:</strong> SQL Injection</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the code for <code>app.get("/vehicle.json",...)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
        <li><strong>Description of Issue:</strong> SQL injection is possible through the query string in the HTTP 
            GET request to <code>"/vehicle.json"</code>. For example, navigation to <code>http://localhost:3000/vehicle.json?username=blah' OR '1'='1"</code>
            will dump the vehicles table. 
            Navigation to <code>http://localhost:3000/vehicle.json?username=blah'; DROP TABLE passengers; SELECT username FROM vehicles WHERE username = 'blah</code>
            will delete the passengers table, wreaking havoc. The image below is the relevant section of the code.<br>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Vulnerability:</strong> Shown below is the database dump version of the vulnerability.<br>
            <img src="./1-2.png">
        </li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Do not trust user input. Use prepared statements and validate user input to ensure it has 
        the desired format.
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issue:</strong> SQL Injection</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the code for <code>app.get("/passengers.json",...)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
        <li><strong>Description of Issue:</strong> Same as in item 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Vulnerability:</strong> Same as in item 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Same as in item 1.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issue:</strong> Potential User Privacy Violation</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the code for <code>app.get("/",...)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
        <li><strong>Description of Issue:</strong> HTTP GET request to <code>"/"</code> displays a list of passengers and where they requested a ride from. 
            This is problematic because it allows anyone to view the location of riders. User location should be confidential except for those 
            who need it, such as drivers. The image below is the relevant section of the code.<br>
            <img src="./2-1.png">
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Vulnerability:</strong> Shown below is the home page of the app.<br>
            <img src="./2-2.png">
        </li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Do not display passenger location on the home page of the app. Alternatively, allow users to log in to 
            the app, and only serve the user locations that they <em>should</em> have access to.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issue:</strong> Cross Origin Resource Sharing</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the code for <code>app.post("/rides",...)</code> and <code>app.post("/update",...)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
        <li><strong>Description of Issue:</strong> The response to HTTP POST requests to the above URIs have CORS enabled, as indicated by the inclusion of 
            <code>response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")</code> in the server code. This will allow any client to access the response, potentially 
            revealing confidential information.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Vulnerability:</strong> See the images below as proof that the code allows any client to POST and receive a reponse.
            We know this must be the case because of the headers added to the response.<br>
            <img src="./3-1.png"><br>
            <img src="./3-2.png">
        </li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Consider white-listing certain specific domains to receive the relevant information from the database 
            instead of allowing anyone to access it by using the wildcard *.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issue:</strong> Potentiality for DoS Attack on App Server</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the code for <code>app.post("/rides",...)</code> and <code>app.post("/update",...)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
        <li><strong>Description of Issue:</strong> By making repeated POST requests to the above URIs, an attacker could tie up the server, 
            reducing the availablity of the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Vulnerability:</strong> None.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Closely monitor network traffic to catch DoS attacks early.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mr. Chow, your app is vulnerable. The database is vulnerable to being read and altered by attackers. Rider location is not private. 
    Anyone can receive a response after a POST request. Lastly, there is the potentiality for a DoS attack. Please take the steps mentioned 
    above to prevent an incident from occurring.
